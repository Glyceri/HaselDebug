# Changelog

## [1.6.5] (2024-09-28)

Update for 7.1.

- **Added:** Unknown Agents will show the Addon name in yellow, if they are active.
- **Added:** Addon Inspector will now highlight the nodes on hover.
- **Fixed:** StdList rendering was incorrect.

## [1.6.4] (2024-09-28)

- **Added:** EventFramework Task History (not very useful, but still better than nothing).
- **Updated:** ClientStructs now at [81fb801](https://github.com/aers/FFXIVClientStructs/tree/81fb801)

## [1.6.3] (2024-07-22)

- **Fixed:** StdMap table column count was incorrect.

## [1.6.2] (2024-07-22)

- **Fixed:** Sheet payloads using a column of type SeString were not evaluated with the ColumnParam expression as lnum(1).
- **Fixed:** Added missing sheets Aetheryte and BNpcName to the Text Decoder tab.

## [1.6.1] (2024-07-22)

- **Fixed:** Some local parameters were not automatically detected, for example the condition in If payloads.

## [1.6.0] (2024-07-21)

- **Added:** The SeString Inspector window now has inputs for local parameters.  
  These are automatically detected from what's in the string. If you find a string with incorrectly detected parameters please open an issue.
- **Added:** The SeString evaluator now evaluates Digit, Head, HeadAll, JaNoun, EnNoun, DeNoun and FrNoun payloads.
- **Fixed:** Strings from the Addon/LogMessage tabs could not be opened in different languages.
- **Fixed:** Evaluating gstr parameters would produce garbage.
- **Fixed:** Evaluating Kilo payloads with a value of 0 would result in an empty string.
- **Fixed:** Evaluating Sheet payloads with a numeric column would produce a string. It now produces a Num payload as a workaround for not being able to write an integer expression directly.

## [1.5.0] (2024-07-20)

- **Added:** A LogMessage tab to search through texts from the LogMessage sheet (until a full Excel tab is implemented).
- **Added:** A language selector to the right of the search bar in the Addon and LogMessage tabs.
- **Added:** Holding shift while closing a SeString Inspector window will close all SeString Inspector windows.
- **Fixed:** The context menu to popout a tab was visible even when the window was already open.

## [1.4.3] (2024-07-19)

- **Changed:** Merged Addon Inspector and Addon Inspector 2 tabs.
- **Fixed:** The `/haseldebug` command didn't auto-register.

## [1.4.2] (2024-07-19)

- **Added:** It's now possible to pop-out tabs (including pinned ones) with a right click -> Open in new window.
- **Updated:** ClientStructs now at [36a3e4c](https://github.com/aers/FFXIVClientStructs/tree/36a3e4c)

## [1.4.1] (2024-07-16)

- **Changed:** Field names are now copyable.
- **Changed:** TreeNodes are now disabled when the struct doesn't have any fields.
- **Changed:** TreeNodes, tables and SeString Inspector windows no longer save ImGui settings (they kinda spammed the config).
- **Other:** TextDecoder was updated to use Luminas SeStringBuilder instead of Utf8Strings. I noticed some names include payloads, which I want to preserve. The TextDecoder tab though extracts the text now, so no payloads are visible there.

## [1.4.0] (2024-07-14)

- **Added:** Instances and Agents are now pinnable.  
  Right-clicking the TreeNode of an Instance or Agent gives an option to pin it to the sidebar. Agents must implement their own struct (AgentInterface is not pinnable).
- **Added:** TreeNodes for Vector2, Vector3 and Vector4 fields now show the coordinates instead of type name.
- **Added:** An Addon tab to search through texts from the Addon sheet (currently just playing around with it).
- **Added:** A new SeString Inspector window (used in the Addon and Chat tab for now).
- **Added:** SeString expressions now have a name, if known.
- **Added:** Agents are now searchable (just the agents name).
- **Added:** Instances are now searchable (just the type name).

## [1.3.0] (2024-07-11)

- **Added:** A new configuration window was added.  
  Accessible via the plugin installer, `/haseldebug config` or the cogwheel in the main window.  
  Currently it only has a single setting to toggle the automatic opening of the main window when the plugin loads.
- **Added:** GameObjects in the Object Table how have a context menu to toggle drawing.
- **Removed:** The Lobby tab was removed as the current CharaSelect character is also listed in the Objects Table.

## [1.2.1] (2024-07-11)

- **Added:** Support for StdList

## [1.2.0] (2024-07-10)

- **Added:** Early version of the Addon Inspector 2 tab.
- **Added:** Unlocks -> Store Items tab.
- **Added:** uint fields named IconId will show their icon in front of their id.
- **Added:** Known byte* strings will now be displayed as string, instead of just a single byte.  
  This has to be maintained by hand. Currently handled fields are:
    - MapMarkerBase.Subtext
    - ExcelSheet.SheetName
- **Changed:** Extend Arrays are now displayed as MapMarkerBase*.
- **Changed:** String Arrays strings are now rendered as SeString, so payloads can be inspected.
- **Changed:** FixedSizeArray strings are now rendered as SeString, so payloads can be inspected.
- **Changed:** Interactable Selectables in the Unlocks tab now show a hand cursor.
- **Changed:** AtkTextures are now in their own TreeNode.
